	  <p> Hello!
My name is Mindy and I&#39;m a graphic designer. I&#39;m currently a junior at MassArt. I study graphic design, but I practice illustration and some photography on my own time. (I will probably add another sentence or two about my work when I can think of how to word it). <br> <br>

When not designing, my passion is for the outdoors. I&#39;ve spent a lot of time farming and gardening, and this has largely influenced much of my design work. Thank you for stopping by!
